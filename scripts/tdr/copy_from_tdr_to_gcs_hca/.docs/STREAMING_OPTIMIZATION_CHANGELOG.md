# Streaming Processing Optimization - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented the final optimization phase for `copy_from_tdr_to_gcs_hca.py`: streaming processing with parallel copying to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Functions Added

#### `process_projects_streaming()`
- **Purpose**: Processes projects one at a time instead of loading all project data into memory simultaneously
- **Benefits**: 
  - Significantly reduced memory footprint for large datasets
  - Better scalability for processing many projects
  - Maintains parallel file copying performance within each project
- **Features**:
  - Processes each project individually with progress tracking (`Project 1/N: project_id`)
  - Accumulates tracking data across all projects for final reporting
  - Includes error handling to continue processing even if one project fails
  - Explicit memory cleanup between projects using `gc.collect()`

#### `_write_output_files()`
- **Purpose**: Helper function to consolidate output file writing logic
- **Benefits**: 
  - Reduces code duplication
  - Centralizes file output formatting
  - Maintains consistent grouping and sorting across all output files

### 2. Updated Dependencies
- Added `import gc` for explicit garbage collection
- Added `import argparse` (was missing from imports)

### 3. Updated Main Function
- Replaced `copy_tdr_to_staging()` call with `process_projects_streaming()`
- Updated function call comment to reflect streaming approach

## Performance Improvements

### Memory Usage
- **Before**: All project data loaded into memory simultaneously
- **After**: Only one project's data in memory at a time, with explicit cleanup between projects
- **Impact**: Enables processing of larger datasets without memory issues

### Processing Approach
- **Before**: Batch processing of all projects
- **After**: Streaming processing with parallel file copying per project
- **Impact**: Better resource utilization and more predictable memory usage

### Error Resilience
- **Before**: Single project failure could impact entire operation
- **After**: Individual project failures don't stop processing of remaining projects
- **Impact**: More robust processing for large-scale operations

## Maintained Features

All existing functionality is preserved:
- ✅ Environment selection (`--env prod/dev`)
- ✅ Enhanced logging with dual console/file output
- ✅ Comprehensive output files (failed URLs, integrity verification, access URLs by bucket)
- ✅ Parallel staging area checking
- ✅ Parallel file copying within projects
- ✅ File integrity verification with checksum comparison
- ✅ Command-line options (`--dry-run`, `--allow-override`, `--skip-integrity-check`)

## Output Files Generated

The script continues to generate all the same output files:
1. `copy_tdr_to_gcs_hca.log` - Complete operation log
2. `failed_access_urls.txt` - Failed copy operations with detailed errors
3. `all_access_urls_by_bucket.txt` - All access URLs grouped by bucket
4. `nonempty_staging_areas.txt` - Non-empty staging areas report
5. `integrity_verification_failed.txt` - Files that failed integrity verification
6. `access_urls.txt` - Raw access URLs (for debugging)
7. `access_urls_filenames_sorted.txt` - Sorted filenames (for debugging)

## Usage

The script usage remains exactly the same:

```bash
# Production environment with integrity checking
python copy_from_tdr_to_gcs_hca.py projects.csv --env prod

# Development environment, dry run
python copy_from_tdr_to_gcs_hca.py projects.csv --env dev --dry-run

# Skip integrity verification for faster copying
python copy_from_tdr_to_gcs_hca.py projects.csv --env prod --skip-integrity-check

# Allow override of non-empty staging areas
python copy_from_tdr_to_gcs_hca.py projects.csv --env prod --allow-override
```

## Legacy Function Status

The original `copy_tdr_to_staging()` function remains in the codebase but is no longer used. It can be removed in a future cleanup if desired, but keeping it provides a fallback option if needed.

## Technical Benefits

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Processes one project at a time, reducing peak memory usage
2. **Scalability**: Can handle datasets with many projects without memory constraints
3. **Performance**: Maintains parallel copying performance within each project
4. **Reliability**: Individual project failures don't stop the entire operation
5. **Monitoring**: Better progress tracking with per-project status updates
6. **Cleanup**: Explicit garbage collection between projects ensures memory is freed

## Verification

The script has been tested for:
- ✅ Syntax correctness (compiles without errors)
- ✅ Command-line argument parsing
- ✅ Help documentation generation
- ✅ Import dependencies resolution

This completes the optimization phases for the TDR to GCS HCA copy script, providing a robust, memory-efficient, and performant solution for large-scale data copying operations.
